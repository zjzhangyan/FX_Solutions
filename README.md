# How Forex Companies Use the Cloud

Forex traders are increasingly moving to the cloud to execute their trading strategies thanks to the convenience of cloud-based solutions.

With cloud computing, instead of building a dedicated data center to enable their online platforms, Forex businesses can rent an elastic cloud computing solution at minimal cost.
As a result, traders can leverage the cloud to check new trading strategies, execute trades and conduct time series analysis to make the right decision, at the right time.


# CURRENT CHALLENGES

For Forex companies wanting to leverage the cloud, you must address a range of challenges to ensure the security and resilience of your cloud-based operations.

## Network
The biggest issue many Forex traders face is latency – where trades need to take place on a global scale and, yet, even a five-millisecond delay can make or break a major deal.

How can you achieve seamless connectivity on a worldwide trading stage? You may assume that by utilizing a network environment like the cloud, your risk of network latency will increase, compared to an on-site data center solution. However, many cloud computing environments now offer low latency applications for high-speed trading, fast management and real-time threat prevention.


 For example, our  [Cloud Enterprise Network](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/cen)(CEN) provides a distributed and hybrid global network that’s ideal for FX businesses that require extensive network coverage, often under high demand. Any of the network instances attached to our CEN can communicate with each other at high speed, high redundancy and low latency, for example the network latency between Beijing DC to Frankfurt DC is around 120 ms with nearly 0 percent package loss via CEN.
