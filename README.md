##THE FOREX INDUSTRY IN THE CLOUD

Forex traders are increasingly moving to the cloud to execute their trading strategies thanks to the convenience of cloud-based solutions.
With cloud computing, instead of building a dedicated data center to enable their online platforms, Forex businesses can rent an elastic cloud computing solution at minimal cost.
As a result, traders can leverage the cloud to check new trading strategies, execute trades and conduct time series analysis to make the right decision, at the right time.

##GLOBALIZATION AND THE CLOUD

Forex is a global marketplace. Trading is not done at one central location but is conducted between traders over the phone and using electronic communication networks in various markets around the world.
The Forex market isn’t dominated by a single market exchange but instead involves a global network of exchanges and brokers around the world.
Just as the Forex market is a global phenomenon, so is the cloud. As such, cloud-based solutions are perfectly placed to meet the global requirements of the Forex market as cloud providers offer an expanding network of nodes and deployment regions, allowing traders to seamlessly do business around the world.
At Alibaba Cloud, for example, we operate in 61 availability zones in 20 regions around the world – with more global regions set to follow.
